Do you need to run them? Or are you just looking in the codes?

In case, you might need audio recordings to run the experiement. I cannot find them for the moment, but if you need them I will look deeper in my messy files ;)

Or if you want to run it only visual, you can change the line :

`Cfg.possibleModalities = {'visual','auditory'};`

in

`Cfg.possibleModalities = {'visual','visual'};`
